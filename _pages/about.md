Hi, welcome to my site ;-; This is the home page.


About me
-------

My name is Théo Chengkai Wang (王程凯). I am currently a Research Intern at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, under the supervision of Gilles Barthe. I have just completed my MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Oxford, and my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. 

I identify as a theoretical computer scientist studying abstract things. My current interests span across programming language theory, quantum computing, and category theory. Recently I also got interested in mechanistic interpretability, which I'm exploring in my spare time. 

One day, the abstract things I create will be worthy of the name of 'abstract non-sense'.
