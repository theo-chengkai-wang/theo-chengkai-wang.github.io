Hi, welcome to my site ;-; This is the home page.


About me
-------

My name is Théo Chengkai Wang (王程凯), currently a Research Assistant at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Jeremy Yallop](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/). Previously, I was a Research Intern at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy with [Gilles Barthe](https://gbarthe.github.io/), an MSc student in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Oxford (thesis supervised by [Sam Staton](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samuel.staton/main.html)), and an undegraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge (thesis supervised by [Jeremy Yallop](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/) and [Alan Mycroft](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/)). 

I identify as a theoretical computer scientist studying abstract things. My current interests span across [programming language theory](https://thelittletyper.com), [verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification), [quantum computing](https://academic.oup.com/book/43710), and [category theory](https://cemulate.github.io/the-mlab/#yBo3-cartesian+bundle). Recently I also got interested in [mechanistic interpretability](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/glossary), as well as [connections](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-43582-0) between legal theory and computer science, both of which I'm exploring in my spare time. 

One day, the abstract things I create will be worthy of the name of 'abstract non-sense'.
