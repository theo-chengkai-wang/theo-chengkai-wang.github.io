The work concerns the application of the simply typed version of [contextual modal type theory](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/papers/tocl07.pdf) (CMTT) to multi-stage programming (MSP). Specifically, we design and implement [Lys](https://github.com/theo-chengkai-wang/lys_language), a MSP language based on CMTT. Then, we study its expressivity in comparison to other MSP paradigms like [MetaOCaml](https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/MetaOCaml.html) by translating programs from MetaOCaml to Lys.
