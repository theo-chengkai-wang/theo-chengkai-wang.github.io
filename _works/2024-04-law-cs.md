For the project part of the [Law and Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/tom.melham/LawAndCS/) course at Oxford, we created OpenQuery, an LLM-powered tool for automating the FOI Act 2000. We follow a classical neuro-symbolic approach, mimicking the legal decision procedure by a (hard-coded) decision tree, and prompting the LLM only for individual decision nodes. This gives us the best of both worlds between guarantees (e.g. transparency and correctness) and performance.
