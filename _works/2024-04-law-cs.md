We create OpenQuery, an LLM-powered tool for automating the FOI Act 2000. We follow a classical neuro-symbolic approach, mimicking the legal decision procedure by a (hard-coded) decision tree, and prompting the LLM only for individual decision nodes. This gives us the best of both worlds between guarantees (e.g. transparency and correctness) and performance.
